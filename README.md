# [WIP] Bee CTRL
The bees are important. Unfortunally, taking care of a bee hive is a time intensive prosess.
Thus, we attempt to make the prosess less time consuming by developing Bee CTRL, an opensource monitoring and allerting system which can be installed
in a bee hive. 

This is a work in progress.
